## by Youngsik Son


## Dataset

- This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
<br/>
- The source data (Ford GoBike System Data) is available at : https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data. Dataset used here is for 2019-02 only.
<br/>
- Each trip is anonymized and includes: Trip Duration (seconds)/ Start Time and Date/ End Time and Date/ Start Station ID/ Start Station Name/ Start Station Latitude/ Start Station Longitude/ End Station ID/ End Station Name/ End Station Latitude/ End Station Longitude/ Bike ID/ User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)


## Summary of Findings

- In Feburary 2019, 89.2% of user types in Ford GoBikes service were Subscribers, and 10.8% of user types were Customers.
<br/>
- Subscribers are primarily daily commuters who use the Ford GoBikes on regular basis on weekdays around 8-9 am and 5-6 pm.
<br/>
- Customers are casually using the Ford GoBikes throughout the week but with longer duration time on the weekends. On the weekdays, Customers mainly use GoBikes in commuting hours just like Subscribers but on the weekends their trips are concentrated 11-4 pm.




## Key Insights for Presentation

Different usage patterns have been found between two types of the users. We can assume that Subscribers are daily commuters who use ther service heavily on the workdays in the main commuting hours. Customers have more touristic characteristics since they ride the GoBikes a lot on the weekends with longer time in the afternoon.
